# React_Udemy
Learn the basics of React from scratch and step by step with Victor Robles. Installation, Components, JSX and more

## Installing reac:
> https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app  
> sudo npm install -g create-react-app

## Generate a new project:
> create-react-app <name_project>  

If it was generated well, it should:

_Success!_ Created projectinitial at /home/marlon/Reat_Udemy/projectinitial
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  > **npm start**  
    Starts the development server.

  > **npm run build**  
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  > **npm test**  
    Starts the test runner.

  > **npm run eject**  
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  > **cd projectinitial  
    npm start**

Happy hacking!

Note: the project was bootstrapped with an old unsupported version of tools.
Please update to Node >=8.10 and npm >=5 to get supported tools in new projects.
